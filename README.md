# Advent of Code

This repository contains all the solutions I have written during [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) events.

All solutions are written in Python, and starting in 2025, the solutions are set up to easily run in Docker, although they can be run using a local Python environment as well.

## Getting started

> [!NOTE]
> The following directions assume you are running the solutions in Docker.

To generate a starting point for the current day's problem, you can run `bin/aoc init`.

To run the current day's solutions, you can simply run `bin/aoc`. This will use the `input/aoc.txt` file by default. You can specify a different input file from the day's input folder by passing `-i example.txt`.

These commands also take arguments to override the default day and the default year.
